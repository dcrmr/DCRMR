<a name="3.20.3.2">3.20.3.2</a> Make a [note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) if the edition statement is transposed from its position on the source of information (see [3.29.X.X](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.29.X.X)).

## 3.20.4 No edition statement 

<a name="3.20.4.1">3.20.4.1</a> If the manifestation does not contain an edition statement, but is known to contain significant changes from other editions, or an edition statement for it is provided by a reference source, do not supply an edition statement based on this information. Give the information in a [note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) (see [3.29.X.X](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.29.X.X)).

<a name="3.20.4.2">3.20.4.2</a> If the manifestation contains only a statement that refers to another edition (e.g., as part of a preface to an earlier edition or a summary of the work’s publication history), do not transcribe the information as an edition statement and do not supply an edition statement based on the information. A [note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) may be made on such statements if considered important (see [3.29.X.X](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.29.X.X)).

<a name="3.20.5.1">3.20.5.1</a> If an edition statement is a grammatically inseparable part of the [title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/), [other title information](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/), [statement of responsibility](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility/), or any other transcribed element, then transcribe as part of the element to which it is integrated or linked and do not repeat it as an edition statement.

If illustration statements or statements such as “in two volumes” appear with an designation of edition statement, transcribe them as they appear (see also [1.23.X.X](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/#1.23.X.X)).

Transcribe edition statements not grammatically linked to another element as individual statements. Indicate the work to which each edition statement corresponds in a [note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) (see [3.29.X.X](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.29.X.X)).

>Example:

<a name="3.20.8.1">3.20.8.1</a> If the manifestation consists of multiple issues or parts, including accompanying material, and there are edition statements relating to the whole as well as to parts, then record only the edition statements relating to the whole manifestation.

## 3.20.91 Edition statements on multipart monographs

<a name="3.20.91.1">3.20.91.1</a> For a multipart monograph, if the edition statement varies or does not appear on all of the volumes, ascertain whether the set was issued as such, using the following guidelines:

1) If other exemplars of the set are known to have the same combination of editions, assume the set was issued as such.  
2) If there is no other exemplar of the set known with the same combination of editions, and other exemplars with different combinations of editions are known, assume the set in hand was not issued as such.  
3) If there are no other known exemplars of the set, assume the set was issued as such.

In case of doubt, assume the set was not issued as such.

>Example:  
>Edition statement: <CITE>v. 1: The second edition</CITE>  
>Edition statement: <CITE>v. 2: The first edition</CITE>  
>Note on edition statement: <CITE>Vol. 1 issued as the second edition and vol. 2 issued as the first edition.</CITE>

<a name="3.20.91.2">3.20.91.2</a> Make a [note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) indicating the absence of edition statements if considered important (see [3.29.X.X}(/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.29.X.X)

>Example:      
>Edition statement: <CITE>The second edition</CITE>  
>Note on edition statement: <CITE>Volumes 2-3 issued without the edition statement</CITE>

<a name="3.20.91.3">3.20.91.3</a> If the multipart monograph is known or assumed to be a made-up set describe the monograph using one of the following methods:

1) Make separate descriptions for each edition. In each description, indicate that the set is imperfect, identifying missing volumes in the [note on extent of item](/DCRMR/Notes-on-items/Note-on-extent-of-item/) (see [8.24.X.X](/DCRMR/Notes-on-items/Note-on-extent-of-item/#8.24.X.X)).

>Example:      
>Edition statement: <CITE>Second edition</CITE>  
>Note on extent of item: <CITE>Library's copy imperfect: v. 2 wanting; a previous owner has supplied v. 2 from the 3rd ed. to create a made-up set</CITE>  
>*Comment:* <CITE>The first of two descriptions associated with the made-up set</CITE>

>Example:       
>Edition statement: <CITE>Third edition</CITE>  
>Note on extent of item: <CITE>Note on extent of item: Library's copy imperfect; v. 1 wanting; a previous owner has supplied v. 1 from the 2nd ed. to create a made-up set</CITE>  
>*Comment:* <CITE>The second of two descriptions associated with the made-up set</CITE>

2) Describe the set, basing the description on the first or preponderant edition. Indicate in the [note on manifestation](/DCRMR/Other-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) that the description is based on a made-up set (see [7.20.X.X](/DCRMR/Other-notes-Note-on-manifestation/#7.20.X.X)).

>Example:      
>Edition statement: <CITE> First edition</CITE>  
>Note on manifestation: <CITE>Description based on a made-up set; v. 3 has "second edition"</CITE>
