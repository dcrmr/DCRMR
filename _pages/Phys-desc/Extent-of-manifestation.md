## 5.20.1 Element information

<a name="5.20.1.1">5.20.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-8754c7a9-c38c-3735-9cf9-865df717f81b){:target="_blank"}

## 5.20.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.20.2.1">5.20.2.1</a> A number and type of unit or subunit of a manifestation.

<a name="5.20.2.2">5.20.2.2</a> [Source of information](/DCRMR/phys-desc/)

## 5.20.3 General rule

 Record the extent of the resource by giving the number of units (using an arabic numeral) and the type of unit. For the type of unit, see [Extent of still image](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X) for still images, [Extent of text](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X) for printed textual works, and [Extent of manuscripts](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X) for all manuscript works. For other formats, choose an appropriate term from the [RDA Carrier Type list](https://www.rdaregistry.info/termList/RDACarrierType/). 
 
 If the resource consists of more than one carrier type and information about the different carrier types is considered important for identification or selection, record the extent by giving the number of units and the term for each carrier type. Specify the number of subunits, if applicable. 

### 5.20.31 Exact number of units not readily ascertainable

If the exact number of units cannot be readily ascertained, record an approximate number preceded by "approximately".

### 5.20.32 Units cannot be named concisely

 If the units cannot be named concisely,  record the number of physical units and describe them as various pieces. Record the details of the pieces in a note if considered important for identification or selection.
 
### 5.20.33 Units and sets of units with identical content. 
 
 If the units of the resource have identical content, add identical before the term indicating the type of unit. If the resource consists of multiple sets of units and each set has identical content, record the number of sets and the number of units in each set in the form 20 identical sets of 12 microscope slides, etc.

### 5.20.34 Incomplete manifestation. 

When preparing a comprehensive description for a resource that is not yet complete, record the term indicating the type of unit without the number. Apply also for a resource when the total number of units issued is unknown.

### 5.20.35 Resources issued in multiple units. 

If the copy in hand is incomplete, but a complete copy is known, record the number and type of unit issued. Record details of missing components in a note on item-specific carrier characteristic. If the extent of a complete manifestation cannot be determined, record the extent of the incomplete manifestation followed by “(incomplete)”. Make a note on extent indicating that the resource is incomplete.

## 5.20.4 Extent of still image

### 5.20.41 Extent of still image: general rule

Record the extent of the resource by giving the number of units (using an arabic numeral) and the type of unit. Do not use square brackets in recording extent.
X.X. For type of unit, prefer a term from the list below: 
* drawing
* painting
* print

For photographs prefer, if applicable, one of the following terms: 
* photographic negative
* photographic print

If none of the terms above are appropriate, use:
* picture, or
* an appropriate term from RDA Extent of manifestation, or
* another concise term
Record the term in singular or plural, as applicable.

### 5.20.42 Stereographs

Treat the paired images of a stereograph as a single item and use the term "stereoscopic photograph".

### 5.20.43 Photomechanical prints

#### 5.20.431 Photographs printed photomechanically. 

If a photographic image has been printed photomechanically (halftone, photogravure, Woodburytype, dye transfer print, ink jet print, etc.), describe it as a photographic print. Record the medium or process in production method.

#### 5.20.432 Other photomechanical prints. 

If a drawn, painted, computer-generated, or other non-photographic image has been printed photomechanically (halftone, photogravure, etc.), describe it as a print. Record the medium or process of production in production method.

### 5.20.44 Technical drawings. 

Treat technical and architectural drawings, whether produced in ink, pencil, blueprint, diazotype, CAD, or other means, as drawings.

### 5.20.45 Multiple types of material. 

When describing a multipart resource containing more than one type of material, record the number of component parts for each type.

**Alternative rule.** Record the total number of units and use the term pictures.

### 5.20.46  Containers and physical carriers for multipart resources. 

Record the number and type of containers or physical carriers immediately following the type of unit when they are original to the material and necessary to accurately communicate its extent. For containers provided by the repository or otherwise not original to the material, make a local note, if considered important. Container and physical carrier terms that may be added to the unit type include, but are not limited to: 
* album
* sketchbook
* portfolio
* volume 
* scrapbook
* box
* CD-ROM
* DVD

### 5.20.47 Multiple images on one support. 

If more than one discrete image is on a single support, indicate this immediately following the unit type.

**Alternative rule**. Make a separate bibliographic record for each image, linking the separate records using “With” notes.

### 5.20.475 Multiple supports for one image

If a single image is composed from more than one sheet, record the number of type of component parts as the extent and unit type. Follow the unit type with a phrase descriptive of the image as a whole.

*Optionally*, emphasize the image as a whole instead and indicate the number of sheets immediately following the unit type.  

### 5.20.48 Incomplete multipart resources

[no instruction]

### 5.20.49 Sets issued in multiple copies. 

Record the number of pictures and/or items issued in the statement of extent. Provide details of missing components in a local note. If the number of components issued cannot be determined, record the number in hand followed by a plus sign. Make a note indicating the set is not complete.

## 5.20.5 Extent of text

### 5.20.52 Manifestations in one physical unit

#### 5.20.521 Manifestations in one physical unit: general rule

<a name="5.20.521.1">5.20.521.1</a> Record every leaf in the volume or other physical unit as issued by the publisher, including leaves of text, leaves of plates, and blank leaves. Do not record leaves added as part of the binding or the binding itself.

<a name="5.20.521.2">5.20.521.2</a> Record the complete number of pages, leaves,  or columns in accordance with the terminology suggested by the volume (or other physical unit) itself. For a volume with leaves numbered on both sides, or with leaves unnumbered and printed on both sides, record the extent in pages. For a volume with leaves numbered on one side only, or with leaves unnumbered and printed on one side only, record the extent in leaves. If the leaves are numbered on one side but printed on both sides, record this fact in a [note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) (see [5.201.3.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.2)). For a volume  with more than one numbered column to the page, record the extent in columns. If a manifestation contains sequences in more than one kind of numbering, record each sequence in its appropriate term as pages, leaves, or columns.

>Example:  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>48 leaves</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Numbered leaves with text on both sides</CITE>

>Example:  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[8], 260, [2] leaves</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Numbered leaves with text on both sides</CITE>

<a name="5.20.521.3">5.20.521.3</a> Record the number on the last numbered page or leaf of each numbered sequence as the basic statement of extent, with any necessary additions according to relevant rules, e.g., [5.20.5.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.5.1), for the addition of unnumbered pages or leaves. Record arabic and roman numerals as they appear in the manifestation. Record roman numerals uppercase or lowercase as they appear. If the pages or leaves are lettered rather than numbered, record the first and last letters followed by the word  indicating pages or leaves.  Record pages, etc. that are numbered in words or in characters other than arabic or roman numerals in arabic numerals.  Make a [Note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) to explain that the pages, etc. are numbered in words or other non-alphanumeric characters (see [5.201.3.3](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.3)).

>Example:  
> <CITE>xvi, 17-328 pages</CITE>

<a name="5.20.521.4">5.20.521.4</a> If the leaves are all or chiefly non-letterpress, record them as leaves or pages of text rather than as leaves or pages of plates as in [Leaves or pages of plates](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X) ([5.20.526](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.526)). Record in [Details of production method](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-production-method/) that the leaves are non-letterpress (see [5.2122.X.X](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-production-method/#5.2122.X.X)).

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>LXXVI leaves</CITE>  
> Details of production method: <CITE>engraved</CITE>

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[1], 13 leaves</CITE>  
> Details of production method: <CITE>Engraved, with a letterpress title page</CITE>

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>28 leaves</CITE>  
> Details of production method: <CITE>Wholly engraved</CITE>

#### 5.20.522 Normally imposed single sheets

<a name="5.20.522.1">5.20.522.1</a> For a normally imposed single-folded (i.e., four-page) sheet, record the statement of extent in the same manner as for a volume. Apply this rule even if only one of the four pages is printed (see [5.201.3.4](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.4)).

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>1, [3] pages</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Last three pages are blank</CITE>

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[4] pages</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Folded single sheet; last three pages are blank.</CITE>

See [Sheets, rolls, cases, portfolios, etc.](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X.) ([5.20.5285](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.5285)) and [Single-sheet publications](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X.) ([5.20.529](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.529)) for all other single-sheet publications.

#### 5.20.5225 Unnumbered pages or leaves

<a name="5.20.5225.1">5.20.5225.1</a> Count unnumbered sequences of pages or leaves according to the terms used to describe the rest of the manifestation or the part of the manifestation with which they are associated. In ambiguous cases count them as leaves when they are all printed on one side only; otherwise count them as pages.  If the gatherings are discernible, include in the count blank leaves at the beginning of the first gathering or at the end of the final gathering when they are present in an item in hand or known to be present in other exemplars of the manifestation. Record the presence of such blank leaves in [Details of layout](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-layout/) (see [5.221.3.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-layout/#5.221.3.1)). Do not count possibly blank leaves wanting according to signature count and not known to exist in other exemplars. Record unnumbered pages or leaves by enclosing the total number in the sequence within square brackets.

> Example:  
> <CITE>[4], 52 pages</CITE>

> Example:  
> <CITE>[6], 321, [1] pages</CITE>

> Example:  
>  <CITE>iv, [40], 328 pages</CITE>

> Example:  
> <CITE>284 leaves, [17] pages</CITE>

<a name="5.20.5225.2">5.20.5225.2</a> Consider numbered sequences to include unnumbered pages or leaves falling logically within the sequence, counting back from the recorded number to 1.

>Example:  
><CITE>[2], 40 pages</CITE>  
>(*Comment:* Pages are numbered 3-40 with four unnumbered pages at the beginning)
> 
>but  
> 
><CITE>[2], 5-40 pages</CITE>  
>(*Comment:* Pages are numbered 5-40 with two unnumbered pages at the beginning; there is no evidence that any leaves are missing)

<a name="5.20.5225.3">5.20.5225.3</a> Record unnumbered blank pages or blank leaves interrupting a numbered sequence by enclosing the number of unnumbered pages or leaves in square brackets between page or leaf numbers where the interruption occurs.

>Example:  
><CITE>200, [8], 201-232 pages</CITE>

>Example:  
><CITE>42, [2], 43-145, [3], 147-161, [3], 163-180, [6] pages</CITE>

#### 5.20.523 Errata leaves

<a name="5.20.523.1">5.20.523.1</a> Include errata leaves (but not errata slips) in the extent statement whether or not they are conjugate with another leaf of the manifestation. Record the presence of errata leaves and errata slips as [Supplementary content](/DCRMR/other-notes/Supplementary-content/) (see [7.232.5.1](/DCRMR/other-notes/Supplementary-content/#7.232.5.1)).

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[2], 46, [2] pages</CITE>  
> Supplementary content: <CITE>Errata on page [47]</CITE>

#### 5.20.5235 Advertisements

<a name="5.20.5235.1">5.20.5235.1</a> Record pages containing only advertisements if those pages are:  

* included in the same pagination sequence as the text;  
* or	 printed on the pages of an initial or final gathering also containing leaves or pages of text;  
* or	 printed on a separate gathering in a manifestation that is continuously signed;  
* or connected by a catchword;  
* or otherwise integral to the manifestation.  

<a name="5.20.5235.2">5.20.5235.2</a> Record the presence of pages that contain only advertisements as [Supplementary content](/DCRMR/other-notes/Supplementary-content/) (see [7.232.4.1](/DCRMR/other-notes/Supplementary-content/#7.232.4.1)).

> Example:  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>iv, 188, [2] pages</CITE>  
> Supplementary content: <CITE>Publisher's advertisements on [2] pages at end</CITE>

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[52], 156, [4] pages</CITE>  
> Supplementary content: <CITE>Publisher's advertisements on [4] pages at end</CITE>

<a name="5.20.5235.3">5.20.5235.3</a> Describe advertisements that do not fall into any of these categories as [Modification of item](/DCRMR/Notes-on-items/Modification-of-item/) if considered important (see [8.21.X.X](/DCRMR/Notes-on-items/Modification-of-item/#8.21.X.X)).

#### 5.20.524 Multiple sequences of numbering

<a name="5.20.524.1">5.20.524.1</a> If the form of numbering within a sequence changes (e.g., from roman to arabic numerals), record each differently numbered part of the sequence. If unnumbered pages appear between the two forms of numbering, record the total number of unnumbered pages in arabic numerals within square brackets.

> Example:  
> <CITE>xvi, 17-328 pages</CITE>

> Example:  
> <CITE>xv, [2], 18-328 pages</CITE>

<a name="5.20.524.2">5.20.524.2</a> If the manifestation has duplicate sequences of paging, as is sometimes the case with manifestations having parallel texts, record both pagings and make an explanatory  [Note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) (see [5.201.3.5](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.5)).

> Example:  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>xii, [1], 35, 35, [1] p.</CITE>  
>Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Opposite pages bear duplicate numbering.</CITE>

>Example:  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[3], 2-11, 2-11, 12 pages, 13-19, 21 leaves, 22-44, [1] pages</CITE>  
>Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Page numbers 2-11 are duplicated on facing pages; 13-18 and 21 are folding letterpress tables, numbered as leaves; pages 22-44 start numbering on recto and are conventionally numbered</CITE>

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[1], vii, vii, [2], vii, vii, 95, 95, 94-131, 94-131, [3] pages</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Text in English and French on opposite pages, numbered in duplicate</CITE>

<a name="5.20.524.3">5.20.524.3</a> If a volume has groups of pages numbered in opposite directions, as is sometimes the case with manifestations having texts in two languages, record the pagings of the various sections in order, starting from the title page or other preferred source of information selected for the description.

> Example:  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[32] pagea</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>German and French bound back to back and inverted (tête-bêche format)</CITE>

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>[8], 334, [2], 32 pages</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>"Prima elementa linguae Syriacae Iesu-Christo vernaculae ... per Iohannem Gasbarum Myricaeum Themarensem Hennembergico-Francum," 32 pages at end, has separate title page and is bound back-to-front. Title in Syriac precedes Latin title</CITE>

<a name="5.20.524.4">5.20.524.4</a> If a volume has pagination of its own and also bears the pagination of a larger resource of which it is a part, record the paging of the individual volume. Record the pagination of the larger sequence in a [Note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) (see [5.201.3.7](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.7)).

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>16 pages</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Pages 4-16 also numbered 196-208</CITE>  


<a name="5.20.8.5">5.20.524.5</a> If the pages, leaves, or columns of a manifestation are numbered as part of a larger sequence (e.g., one volume of a multipart publication), record the number of the first and the last numbered page, leaf, or column, preceded by the appropriate term. 

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>pages [1], 432-488</CITE>  
> (*Comment:* An offprint from Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, volume 4, part 2, Manchester, 1796)

<a name="5.20.524.6">5.20.524.6</a> If a manifestation contains  multiple sequences of numbered or unnumbered pages, leaves, or columns, preferably record all of the sequences in the form and sequence presented. 

> Example:  
> <CITE>xiv pages, xv-xlii, 496 columns, [1], 498-534, [2] pages</CITE>  

> Example:  
> <CITE>[14], 196 pages, 197-200 leaves, 200, [8], 201-569, [3], 573-599, 596-654, 657-706, [20] pages</CITE>  

If it is not practical to record all the sequences (e.g., if they are exceedingly numerous), then employ one of the following methods: 

a)	Record the total number of pages, leaves, or columns followed by “in various pagings,”  “in various foliations,” or “in various numberings.”  

b)	Record the number of pages, leaves, or columns in the main sequence and the total number of the remaining variously numbered or unnumbered sequences.  

> Example:  
> <CITE>77, [3] pages, [50] leaves of plates (in various foliations)</CITE> 

c)	As a last resort, record the physical unit  in which the manifestation was issued (volume, case, or portfolio) followed by “(various pagings),” “(various foliations),” or “(various numberings).”

If one of these methods is employed, record all of the sequences in a [note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/)  if considered important (see [5.201.3.8](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.8)).

#### 5.20.5245 Expansions or corrections

<a name="5.20.5245.1">5.20.5245.1</a> Make a [Note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) giving more precise information about pagination or foliation, blank pages or leaves, or other aspects of collation if considered important (see [5.201.3.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.1)).

<a name="5.20.5245.2">5.20.5245.2</a> If the number of the last numbered page, leaf, or column of a sequence does not indicate the correct number of pages, etc., either record the sequences exactly to indicate the source of the error or record the number as given in the manifestation and supply a correction. When correcting misleading numbering, record the numbering as it appears on the last page or leaf followed by “that is” and the correct number in square brackets. Provide an explanatory [Note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) if considered important (see [5.201.3.8](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.8)).

> Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>564 [that is, 56] leaves</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Leaf 56 wrongly numbered 564</CITE> 

If the manifestation is numbered as leaves, but printed as pages (see [5.20.8.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.8.2)).

#### 5.20.525 Lack of numbering

<a name="5.20.525.1">5.20.525.1</a> If the whole volume is unpaginated or unfoliated, count the pages or leaves and record the total in arabic numerals within square brackets. State the total in terms of pages or leaves, but not of both. Begin the count with the first page or leaf of the first gathering and end the count with the last page or leaf of the last gathering, as instructed in [Unnumbered pages or leaves](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/X.X) ([5.20.5225.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.5225.1)). Count all blank pages or leaves.

> Example:  
> <CITE>[94] pages</CITE> 

<a name="5.20.525.2">5.20.525.2</a> *Optionally,* if determining the total number of pages or leaves of an unnumbered volume might damage an item in fragile condition, give one of the designations used for manifestations issued in more than one physical unit (see [5.20.531.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.531.1)) followed by “unpaged” or “unfoliated.”

#### 5.20.526 Leaves or pages of plates

<a name="5.20.526.1">5.20.526.1</a> Record the number of leaves or pages of plates at the end of the sequence(s) of pagination or foliation, whether the plates are found together or distributed throughout the manifestation. Record the number even when there is only one plate. For a  plate folded and bound at the inner margin (see [Double leaves](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#X.X), [5.20.5275.
1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#5.20.5275.1)). Count unnumbered leaves or pages of plates without regard for the terms used to describe the rest of the manifestation (accordingly, leaves of plates may follow sequences of pages and pages of plates may follow sequences of leaves).

> Example:  
> <CITE>viii, 132 pages, iv pages of plates</CITE> 

> Example:  
> <CITE>x, 32, [2] pages, xxii leaves of plates</CITE> 

>Example:  
> <CITE>[12] pages, 924 columns, [129], 432, [18], 43 pages, 44-77 columns, [6], 90-160, [6] pages, [1] leaf of plates</CITE> 

<a name="5.20.526.2">5.20.526.2</a> In general, record the exact number of leaves or pages of plates. If it is not practical to record all the sequences (e.g., if they are exceedingly numerous), record an estimated number.

>Example:  
> <CITE>viii, 298 pages, approximately 55 leaves of plates</CITE> 

<a name="5.20.526.3">5.20.526.3</a> If a volume contains a mixture of unnumbered leaves and pages of plates, record the number either in terms of leaves or of pages. Record unnumbered pages or leaves by enclosing the total number in the sequence within square brackets.

>Example:  
> <CITE>[12] pages, [24] pages of plates, [2] leaves of plates</CITE> 

>Example:  
> <CITE>[2], ii, ii, 11, [5] pages, [50] leaves of plates</CITE> 

<a name="5.20.526.4">5.20.526.4</a> Count title pages (and added title pages) as leaves or pages of plates if they are entirely or chiefly non-letterpress (e.g., engraved or lithographed) and not integral to any letterpress gatherings. Make a [Note on extent of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/) to indicate any title page counted as a plate (see [5.201.3.9](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-extent-of-manifestation/#5.201.3.9)).

>Example:  
> Extent of manifestation: <CITE>112 pages, [1] leaf of plates</CITE>  
> Note on extent of manifestation: <CITE>Plate has engraved title page on recto and blank verso</CITE> 

<a name="5.20.526.5">5.20.526.5</a> As a last resort, if a manifestation’s gatherings cannot be ascertained, or it is otherwise difficult to tell whether a leaf constitutes a plate, record it in terms of pages or leaves of plates if unnumbered and pages or leaves of text if included in the numbering sequence of the text.
