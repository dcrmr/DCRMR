## 4.211.2 Definition and scope

<a name="4.211.2.1">4.211.2.1</a> A place associated with the distribution of a published manifestation.

## 4.211.3 General rule

<a name="4.211.3.1">4.211.3.1</a> Transcribe the names of places associated with the distribution of a published manifestation as part of this element. Transcribe the place of distribution as it appears on the manifestation. If the place appears together with the name of a larger jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, or similar designation), or multiple such jurisdictions, transcribe these as well.

Example: `Elizabeth-Town`

Example: `Köln`

Example: `Apud inclytam Germaniae Basileam`

Example: `Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Boston`

Example: `Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada`

## 4.211.4 Places of distribution with initial prepositions, etc.

<a name="4.211.4.1">4.211.4.1</a>  Include in the transcription any prepositions appearing before the place of distribution as well as any accompanying words or phrases associated with the place name.

Example: `A Lyon`

Example: `In London`

Example: `In Boston, printed`

(*Comment:* Title page reads: “In Boston, printed. 1705.” Following provisions of 4D3, “printed” is here transcribed with the place)

Example: `Printed at Bennington`

Example: `Impressum fuit hoc opus Venetiis`

## 4.211.5 Supplied modern forms of place names

<a name="4.211.5.1">4.211.5.1</a>  If considered necessary for identification and if known, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use an English form of the name, if there is one.

Example: `Christiania [Oslo]`

Example: `Eboracum [York]`

Example: `Monachii [Munich]`

## 4.211.6 Supplied fuller forms of place names 

<a name="4.211.6.1">4.211.6.1</a>  If a place name is found only in an abbreviated form on the manifestation, transcribe it as found. Supply in square brackets the full form of the name, or the remainder of the name, if considered necessary for identification.

Example: `Mpls [i.e. Minneapolis]`

Example: `Rio [de Janeiro]`

## 4.211.7 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="4.211.7.1">4.211.7.1</a>  Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one. Use the abbreviations listed in [RDA Toolkit > Resources > Abbreviations and symbols](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-aacfb802-7f30-3bcd-8311-3f8b52c0c42c). 

Example: `Cambridge [England]`

Example: `Newport [R.I.]`

Example: `Washington [Pa.]`

## 4.211.8 Two or more places of distribution

<a name="4.211.8.1">4.211.8.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of distribution, and all are related to the same distributor, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

Example: `London ; York`

Example: `A Lausanne & se trouve à Paris`

<a name="4.211.8.2">4.211.8.2</a> *Optionally,* if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of distribution may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

Example: `London ; Reading ; Bath ... [and 6 other cities in England]`

<a name="4.211.8.3">4.211.8.3</a> If a subsequent place of distribution is not related to the same distributor, transcribe it in association with the distributor to which it corresponds.

Example: `New York : Ivison, Phinney, and Co. ; London : Trübner & Co.`

<a name="4.211.8.4">4.211.8.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of distribution if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

Example: `Printed at Worcester, Massachusetts : By Isaiah Thomas : Sold by him in Worcester, by said Thomas and Andrews in Boston, and by said Thomas and Carlisle, in Walpole, Newhampshire`

<a name="4.211.8.5">4.211.8.5</a> If a place of distribution associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of distribution of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

Example: `Philadelphia printed, London reprinted`

<a name="4.211.8.6">4.211.8.6</a> If both the place and distributor associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and distributor of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the distributor to which it corresponds.

Example: `London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York`

## 4.211.9 Places of distribution in multipart monographs

<a name="4.211.9.1">4.211.9.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part, and the place of distribution changes in the course of publication, give the place of distribution of the later part(s) in a note on distribution statement (see [4.216.4.1](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.1)).

Example: `Stuttgart ; Tübingen`

**Note on distribution statement:** `Place of distribution in v. 33-40: Stuttgart ; Augsburg`

## 4.211.95 Place names that are grammatically inseparable parts of other elements 

<a name="4.211.95.1">4.211.95.1</a> If the place of distribution appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another element and is transcribed there, supply the place of distribution in square brackets (see [4.21.4.3](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Distribution-statement/#4.21.4.3)). Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one.

Example: `[Munich] : Durch Peter Clement, Kunstführer zu München`

## 4.211.96 Fictitious or incorrect places of distribution

<a name="4.211.96.1">4.211.96.1</a> If the place of distribution appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory note. If the actual place is known, or can be reasonably surmised, supply a correction in square brackets. Use a modern English form of name, if there is one, and give the basis for the correction in a note on distribution statement (see [4.216.4.2](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.2)).

Example: `Londres [i.e. Paris]`

**Note on distribution statement:** `Actual place of publication from: Weller, E.O.  Falsche Druckorte`

## 4.211.97 No place of distribution
<a name="4.211.97.1">4.211.97.1</a> If no place of distribution appears on the manifestation but is known,  supply it in square brackets. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one, and include the name of the larger jurisdiction if considered necessary for identification. Use the location associated with the first transcribed distributor if one is present. Provide a justification for the supplied place in a note on distribution statement if neccesary (see [4.216.4.3](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.3)).

Example: `[Cambridge, Mass.] : Printed by Samuel Green, 1668`

**Note on distribution statement:** `Samuel Green was located in Cambridge, Mass., from 1660 to 1672`

<a name="4.211.97.2">4.211.97.2</a> If the name of the place of distribution has changed over time, supply the name appropriate to the date of distribution if known (e.g., Leningrad, not Saint Petersburg, for manifestations published in that city between 1924 and 1991). If considered necessary for identification, also supply the modern place name and the name of the larger jurisdiction. 

Example: `[Christiania i.e. Oslo]`

Example: `[Leona Vicario i.e. Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico]`

## 4.211.98 Place of distribution supplied based on address or sign

<a name="4.211.98.1">4.211.98.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the place of distribution using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, when only an address or description of a trade sign appears on the manifestation. (Transcribe the address or sign as the name of distributor element ; see [4.213.5.1](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Name-of-distributor/#4.213.5.1)). When supplying the place, give a justification in a note on distribution if necessary (see [4.216.4.3](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.3)).

Example: `[Paris]`
(*Comment:* Imprint reads: “à l’enseigne de l’éléphant,” the trade sign of a Parisian printer)

Example: `[London]`
(*Comment:* Imprint reads: “sold in St. Paul’s Church Yard”)

## 4.211.99 Place of distribution uncertain or unknown

<a name="4.211.99.1">4.211.99.1</a> If the place of distribution is uncertain, supply the name of the probable place of distribution with a question mark, using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, all in square brackets.

Example: `[Amsterdam?]`

Example: `[Newport, R.I.?]`

Example: `[Saint Petersburg?]`

<a name="4.211.99.2">4.211.99.2</a>  If no city of distribution can be conjectured, supply the name of a state, province, country, or other larger geographic entity as the place of distribution with a question mark if necessary, using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, all in square brackets.

Example: `[Canada]`

Example: `[Surrey?]`

Example: `[Prussia?]`

Example: `[South America?]`

<a name="4.211.99.3">4.211.99.3</a> If the reason for supplying the place is not apparent from the rest of the description, make a note on distribution statement to indicate the source of the information (see [4.216.4.4](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.4.4)). 

 **Note on distribution statement:** `Place of publication suggested by Alden`

<a name="4.211.99.4">4.211.99.4</a> If no place of distribution can be conjectured, record “Place of distribution not identified” in square brackets.

Example: `[Place of distribution not identified]`

## 4.211.995 Place names in more than one language or script

<a name="4.211.995.1">4.211.995.1</a>  If the name of the place of distribution appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the title proper, or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel place of distribution](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-distribution/)). Make a note on distribution statement to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [4.216.7.1](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#4.216.7.1)).
