## 4.212.2 Definition and scope

<a name="4.212.2.1">4.212.2.1</a>  A place of manufacture in another language or script.

## 4.212.3 Manufacture place names in more than one language or script

<a name="4.212.3.1">4.212.3.1</a> If the [place of manufacture](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/) appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the title proper as a [place of manufacture](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/) element.  If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the [place of manufacture](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/) that appears first.

<a name="4.212.3.2">4.212.3.2</a> Transcribe remaining places of manufacture as parallel places of manufacture. If a parallel place of manufacture is from a different source than the place of manufacture, make a note on manufacture statement if considered important for identification (see [4.226.7.1](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#4.226.7.1)).

<a name="4.212.3.3">4.212.3.3</a> *Optionally,* if the parallel places of manufacture are too numerous to record exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification then all parallel places of manufacture after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.
