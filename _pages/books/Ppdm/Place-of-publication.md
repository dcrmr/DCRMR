## 4.201.2 Definition and scope

<a name="4.201.2.1">4.201.2.1</a> A place associated with the publication, release, or issuing of a published manifestation.

## 4.201.3 General rule

<a name="4.201.3.1">4.201.3.1</a> Transcribe the names of places associated with the publication, release, or issuing of a published manifestation as part of this element. 

<a name="4.201.3.2">4.201.3.2</a> Transcribe the place of publication as it appears on the manifestation. If the place appears together with the name of a larger jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, or similar designation), or multiple such jurisdictions, transcribe these as well.

Example: `Elizabeth-Town`

Example: `Köln`

Example: `Apud inclytam Germaniae Basileam`

Example: `Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Boston`

Example: `Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada`

## 4.201.4 Place of publication with initial prepositions, etc.

<a name="4.201.4.1">4.201.4.1</a> Include in the transcription any prepositions appearing before the place of publication, as well as any accompanying words or phrases associated with the place name.

Example: `A Lyon`

Example: `In London`

Example: `In Boston, printed`

(*Comment:* Title page reads: “In Boston, printed. 1705.” Following provisions of 4D3, “printed” is here transcribed with the place)

Example: `Printed at Bennington`

Example: `Impressum fuit hoc opus Venetiis`

## 4.201.5 Supplied modern forms of place names

<a name="4.201.5.1">4.201.5.1</a> If considered necessary for identification and if known, supply in square brackets the modern form of the name of the place. Use an English form of the name, if there is one.

Example: `Christiania [Oslo]`

Example: `Eboracum [York]`

Example: `Monachii [Munich]`

## 4.201.6 Supplied fuller forms of place names

<a name="4.201.6.1">4.201.6.1</a> If a place name is found only in an abbreviated form on the manifestation, transcribe it as found. Supply in square brackets the full form of the name, or the remainder of the name, if considered necessary for identification.

Example: `Mpls [i.e. Minneapolis]`

Example: `Rio [de Janeiro]`

## 4.201.7 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="4.201.7.1">4.201.7.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one. Use the abbreviations listed in [RDA Toolkit > Resources > Abbreviations and symbols](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Resource?externalId=en-US_ala-aacfb802-7f30-3bcd-8311-3f8b52c0c42c).  

Example: `Cambridge [England]`

Example: `Newport [R.I.]`

Example: `Washington [Pa.]`

## 4.201.8 Two or more places of publication

<a name="4.201.8.1">4.201.8.1</a> If the manifestation shows two or more places of publication, and all are related to the same publisher, transcribe all in the order in which they appear.

Example: `London ; York`

Example: `A Lausanne & se trouve à Paris`

<a name="4.201.8.2">4.201.8.2</a> *Optionally,* if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the place of publication may be shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

Example: `London ; Reading ; Bath ... [and 6 other cities in England]`

<a name="4.201.8.3">4.201.8.3</a> If a subsequent place of publication is not related to the same publisher, distributor, etc., transcribe it in association with the publisher to which it corresponds.

Example: `New York : Ivison, Phinney, and Co. ; London : Trübner & Co.`

<a name="4.201.8.4">4.201.8.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a place of publication if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

Example: `Printed at Worcester, Massachusetts : By Isaiah Thomas : Sold by him in Worcester, by said Thomas and Andrews in Boston, and by said Thomas and Carlisle, in Walpole, Newhampshire`

<a name="4.201.8.5">4.201.8.5</a>  If a place of publication associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of publication of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

Example: `Philadelphia printed, London reprinted`

<a name="4.201.8.6">4.201.8.6</a>  If both the place and publisher associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and publisher of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the publisher to which it corresponds.

Example: `London : Printed for Knight and Lacy, Paternoster-Row ; Greenfield, Mass. : Re-printed by Ansel Phelps, and for sale by him at his bookstore, also by West & Richardson, Cummings, Hilliard & Co., Boston, and Wilder & Campbell, New-York`

## 4.201.9 Places of publication in multipart monographs

<a name="4.201.9.1">4.201.9.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part, and the place of publication changes in the course of publication, give the place of publication of the later part(s) in a note on publication statement (see [4.206.4.1](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.4.1)).

Example: `Stuttgart ; Tübingen`

**Note on distribution statement:** `Place of publication in v. 33-40: Stuttgart ; Augsburg`

## 4.201.95 Place names that are grammatically inseparable parts of other areas, etc.

<a name="4.201.95.1">4.201.95.1</a> If the place of publication appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of another area and is transcribed there, or appears only as a grammatically inseparable part of the publisher statement and is transcribed there, supply in square brackets the place of publication as the first element of the [publication statement](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Publication-statement/)). Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one.

Example: `[Munich] : Durch Peter Clement, Kunstführer zu München`

## 4.201.96 Fictitious or incorrect places of publication

<a name="4.201.96.1">4.201.96.1</a> If the place of publication appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory note. If the actual place is known, or can be reasonably surmised, supply a correction in square brackets. Use a modern English form of name, if there is one, and give the basis for the correction in a note on publication statement (see [4.206.4.2](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.4.2)).

Example: `Londres [i.e. Paris]`

**Note on distribution statement:** `Actual place of publication from: Weller, E.O.  Falsche Druckorte`

## 4.201.97 No place of publication
<a name="4.201.97.1">4.201.97.1</a> If no place of publication appears on the manifestation but is known, supply it in square brackets. Use a modern English form of the name, if there is one, and include the name of the larger jurisdiction if considered necessary for identification. Use the location associated with the first transcribed publisher statement if one is present. Provide a justification for the supplied place in a note on publication statement if necessary (see [4.206.4.3](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.4.3)).

Example: `[Cambridge, Mass.] : Printed by Samuel Green, 1668`

**Note on publication statement:** `Samuel Green was located in Cambridge, Mass., from 1660 to 1672`

<a name="4.201.97.2">4.201.97.2</a> If the name of the place of publication has changed over time, supply the name appropriate to the date of publication if known (e.g., Leningrad, not Saint Petersburg, for works resources in that city between 1924 and 1991). If considered necessary for identification, also supply the modern place name and the name of the larger jurisdiction. 

Example: `[Christiania i.e. Oslo]`

Example: `[Leona Vicario i.e. Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico]`

## 4.201.98 Place of publication supplied based on address or sign

<a name="4.201.98.1">4.201.98.1</a>  Supply in square brackets the name of the place of publication using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, when only an address or description of a trade sign appears on the manifestation. Transcribe the address or sign as the [publication statement](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Publication-statement/).  When supplying a place of publication, give a justification in a note on publication statement if necessary (see [4.206.4.4](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.4.4)).

Example: `[Paris]`

(*Comment:* Imprint reads: “à l’enseigne de l’éléphant,” the trade sign of a Parisian printer)

(*Comment:* Imprint reads: “sold in St. Paul’s Church Yard”)

## 4.201.99 Place of publication uncertain or unknown
<a name="4.201.99.1">4.201.99.1</a>  If the place of publication is uncertain, supply the name of a probable place of publication with a question mark, using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, all in square brackets.

Example: `[Amsterdam?]`

Example: `[Newport, R.I.?]`

Example: `[Saint Petersburg?]`

<a name="4.201.99.2">4.201.99.2</a> If no city of publication can be conjectured, supply the name of a state, province, country, or other larger geographic entity as the place of publication with a question mark if necessary, using a modern English form of the name, if there is one, all in square brackets.

Example: `[Canada]`

Example: `[Surrey?]`

Example: `[Prussia?]`

Example: `[South America?]`

<a name="4.201.99.3">4.201.99.3</a> If the reason for supplying the place is not apparent from the rest of the description, make a note on publication statement to indicate the source of the information.
(see [4.206.4.5](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.4.5)).

Example: `Place of publication suggested by Alden`

<a name="4.201.99.4">4.201.99.4</a>  If no place of publication can be conjectured, record "Place of publication not identified" in square brackets.

Example: `[Place of publication not identified]`

## 4.201.995 Place names in more than one language or script
<a name="4.201.995.1">4.201.995.1</a>  If the name of the place of publication appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the title proper, or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel places of publication. Make a note on publication statement to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [4.206.4.6](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.4.6)).
