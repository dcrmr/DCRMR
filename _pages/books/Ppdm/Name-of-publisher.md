<a name="4.203.6.1">4.203.6.1</a> If the name of publisher is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and make an explanatory note.

<a name="4.203.7.1">4.203.7.1</a>  If the [publication statement](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Publication-statement/) includes more than one publisher in a single source, transcribe all the names in the order indicated by the sequence, layout, or typography of the names on the source of information. Transcribe them as subsequent statements of publication only when they are not linked by connecting words or phrases.

<a name="4.203.7.2">4.203.7.2</a>  *Optionally,* if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, the [publication statement](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Publication-statement/) may be shortened by omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission.

<a name="4.203.7.3">4.203.7.3</a> If the name of a publisher associated with an earlier edition appears together with the name of the actual publisher of the edition being described, transcribe the names as a single element in the order in which they appear.

Example: `Published by the Surveyor General, pursuant to an act of the legislature, Stone & Clark, republishers, 1839`

<a name="4.203.7.4">4.203.7.4</a>  If both the place and publisher associated with an earlier edition appear together with the place and publisher of the edition being described, transcribe each publisher with the place to which it corresponds.

## 4.203.9 Supplied and conjectured names of publishers

<a name="4.203.9.1">4.203.9.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a publisher appears on the manifestation, supply the name of the publisher in square brackets if known. If the responsibility of a publisher for a particular manifestation is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a note. In any case of a supplied publisher give supporting evidence in a note on publication statement (see [4.206.5.5](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.5.5)).

Example: `[Anton Koberger]`

## 4.203.95 No supplied name of publisher

<a name="4.203.95.1">4.203.95.1</a> If no publisher’s name can be conjectured, record “publisher not identified” in square brackets.

## 4.203.96 Publisher transcribed as part of another element 

<a name="4.203.96.1">4.203.96.1</a> If no formal publisher’s name statement appears on the manifestation, and the name of the publisher has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it within square brackets.

Example: `[Paris] : [Pour Symo[n] Vostre Libraire par Philippe Pigouchet]`

(*Comment*: Title reads “Ces presentes heures a lusaige de Ro[m]me : so[n]t au lo[n]g sa[n]s req[ue]rir [et] ont este faictes pour Symo[n] Vostre Libraire: demourent a Paris a la rue neuue nostre dame, a lenseigne Sainct Iehan leuangeliste par Philippe Pigouchet.”)

<a name="4.203.97.1">4.203.97.1</a>  If the name of the publisher appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the title proper, or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements (see [Parallel name of publisher](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-publisher/).  Make a note to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed statements (see [4.206.6.2](/DCRMR/books/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#4.206.6.2)).
