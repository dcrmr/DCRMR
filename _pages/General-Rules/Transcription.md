## 0.5.0 General guidelines on transcription

Transcribe information in the form and order in which it is presented in the resource, according to these general rules (0.5), unless instructed otherwise by specific rules. Do not use the mark of omission to indicate transposition.

DCRMR normalizes puncutation and capitalization based on current conventions, with an optional exception in punctuation (0.5.2). If nonnormalized transcription is considered important, follow [RDA Guidelines on basic transcription](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Guidance/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-fd2213e6-ae72-3e6f-8f0a-be3fc0e8d728 "RDA Guidelines on basic transcription") and consistently apply it throughout the resource description.

## 0.5.1 Capitalization

<a name="0.5.1.0">0.5.1.0</a>Convert letters to uppercase or lowercase according to the guidelines for [Capitalization](https://beta.rdatoolkit.org/Resource/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-f32d79b7-2177-300c-ae09-639ac89b5d49 "RDA: Capitalization") in the RDA Toolkit, with the following exceptions. 

For guidelines converting I or V to lowercase, or i, j, u, or v to uppercase, see XXXXXX.

<a name="0.5.1.x">0.5.1.x. Roman numerals</a>

Do not convert case when transcribing roman numerals.

<a name="0.5.1.x">0.5.1.x. Final capital "I" in Latin</a>

Do not convert to lowercase a final capital I in Latin texts when the final I is uppercase and the immediately preceding letters in the word are lowercase or smaller capital letters. Since this usage is not merely typographic but affects meaning, the capital must be left in that form.

Example: 
M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae

*Source of information reads:* M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae

Example:
ValerI Andreae DesselI I.C. Bibliotheca Belgica

If the letter occurs within the first five words of the title proper (the first six words if the title begins with an article), record a variant title for the form of title with the final capital I converted to ii (see 2.3.6).
