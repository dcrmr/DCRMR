A pictorial, diagrammatic, or other graphic representation occurring within a publication, excepting minor decorative elements such as vignettes, head- and tail-pieces, historiated initials, and printers’ ornaments.

## **Impression.**
All copies produced in the course of one printing event; the term is synonymous with “printing.” *See also* **[Copy](DCRMR/glossary/Letter/#Copy).** 

## **Inscription.**
Text hand-lettered on an item prior to acquisition by the repository, especially when for documentation or commemoration. 

## **Integral.**

1. A leaf is integral to a gathering if it is conjugate with another leaf in the gathering. 2. A leaf is integral to a publication if it can be assumed to be present in all copies represented by the bibliographic description. Leaves added after publication by an owner (e.g., extra-illustrated copies) or by a binder are not considered integral to the publication and thus must be described in local notes.

## **Issue.**
A group of published copies which constitutes a consciously planned publishing unit, distinguishable from other groups of published copies by one or more differences designed expressly to identify the group as a discrete unit.

## **Item.**
A single exemplar or instance of a manifestation.
