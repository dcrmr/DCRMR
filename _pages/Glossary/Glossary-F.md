## **Facsimile.**
An illustrative content that consists of an exact copy of an original, usually in the same dimensions as the original, especially of books, documents, prints, and drawings. Today the original is often reproduced photographically or digitally; in the past, it was reproduced by engraving or another printmaking process. *See also* **[Reissue](/DCRMR/glossary/R/#reissue).**

## **Fascicle.**
One of the temporary divisions of a printed resource that, for convenience in printing or publication, is issued in small installments, usually incomplete in themselves; they do not necessarily coincide with any formal division of the work into parts, etc. Usually the fascicle is protected by temporary paper wrappers. It may or may not be numbered. A fascicle is distinguished from a part by being a temporary division of a work rather than a formal component unit.

## **Fingerprint.**
A nomen that is an identifier for manifestation of an early printed resource that consists of a sequence of characters from sources of information specified by an established scheme.
